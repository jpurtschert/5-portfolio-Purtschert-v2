ABOUT

Hi, my name is Julie and I am a senior from Andover High School.  I am 17 years old and have lived in Andover all of my life with my parents, younger sister, and 2 cats.  During the summer I love to spend time with my family and friends at the beach and some of my other interests include softball, yoga, and bullet journaling.  I work after school and in the summer at the Professional Center for Child Development as a classroom assistant substitute and as an office clerk.   

CHILDREN

I am the oldest of all of my cousins and grew up helping to care for my sister and cousins.  I do a lot of babysitting and hope to make teaching children a part of my career in the future.  

TRAVEL

With my grandparents in Australia and my uncle in Switzerland, I have had lots of opportunity for travel with my family.  I have visited each of these countries three times and, as of a few years ago, I hold tri-citizenship.

ORGANIZATION

Everything in my life is extremely organized with lists and folders and color-coding systems.  Over the years I have become very good at turning chaos into something logical and organized.
